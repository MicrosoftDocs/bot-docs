      - question: How do I create my own App Registration?
        answer: |
          Creating your own App Registration is necessary for situations like the following:

          - You created your bot in the Bot Framework portal (such as https://dev.botframework.com/bots/new)
          - You are unable to make app registrations in your organization and need another party to create the App ID for the bot you're building
          - You otherwise need to manually create your own App ID (and password)

          To create your own App ID, follow these steps:

          1. Sign into your [Azure account](https://portal.azure.com). If you don't have an Azure account, you can [sign up for a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
          1. Go to [the app registrations blade](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade) and click **New registration** in the action bar at the top.

             ![new registration](media/app-registration/new-registration.png)

          1. Enter a display name for the application registration in the *Name* field and select the supported account types. The name does not have to match the bot ID.

             > [!IMPORTANT]
             > In the section **Supports account types**, choose the multi-tenant type **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD - Multitenant)**, when creating the app.
             > Failing to do so, will result in a non-functional bot.
             > For more information, see [Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#register-a-new-application-using-the-azure-portal).

             ![registration details](media/app-registration/registration-details.png)

          1. Click **Register**

             After a few moments, the newly created app registration should open a blade. Copy the *Application (client) ID* in the Overview blade and paste it in to the App ID field.

             ![application id](media/app-registration/app-id.png)

          If you're creating your bot through the Bot Framework portal, then you're done setting up your app registration; the secret will be generated automatically.

          If you're making your bot in the Azure portal, you need to generate a secret for your app registration.

          1. Click on **Certificates & secrets** in the left navigation column of your app registration's blade.
          1. In that blade, click the **New client secret** button. In the dialog that pops up, enter an optional description for the secret and select **Never** from the Expires radio button group.

             ![new secret](media/app-registration/new-secret.png)

          1. Copy your secret's value from the table under *Client secrets* and paste it into the *Password* field for your application, and click **OK** at the bottom of that blade. Then, proceed with the bot creation.

             > [!NOTE]
             > The secret will only be visible while on this blade, and you won't be able to retrieve it after you leave that page. Be sure to copy it somewhere safe.

      - question: What files do I need to zip up for deployment?
        answer: |
          You must manually create a zip archive with all the files in the project, as described in the step: [zip up the code directory manually step](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-deploy-az-cli?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=csharp#52-zip-up-the-code-directory-manually).
          Please, make sure that you select all the files and folders in your bot's project folder.
          Then, while still in the project folder, zip up all the selected files and folders as shown in the picture below.

      - question: What version of Azure CLI should I use to deploy a bot?
        answer: |
          Use the latest version of the Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) otherwise you will get deprecated commands errors.
          See [Install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

      - question: What should I do when getting Azure CLI deprecation errors?
        answer: |
          Upgrade to the latest version of the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
          For Azure CLI version [2.2.0](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs-cli/blob/master/docs-ref-conceptual/release-notes-azure-cli.md#march-10-2020) or later,
          you must use `az deployment sub create` and `az deployment group create` instead of `az deployment create` and `az group deployment create` commands respectively.
