# Set up continuous deployment

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-v4](includes/applies-to-v4-current.md)]

This article shows you how to configure continuous deployment for your bot. You can enable continuous deployment to automatically deploy code changes from your source repository to Azure. In this topic, we'll cover setting up continuous deployment for GitHub. For information on setting up continuous deployment with other source control systems, see the additional resource section at the bottom of this page.

## Prerequisites

- If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://portal.azure.com) before you begin.
- You **must** [deploy your bot to Azure](bot-builder-deploy-az-cli.md) before enabling continuous deployment.

## Prepare your repository

Make sure that your repository root has the correct files in your project. This will allow you to get automatic builds from the build provider.

|Runtime | Root directory files |
|:-------|:---------------------|
| ASP.NET Core | .sln or .csproj |
| Node.js | server.js, app.js, or package.json with a start script |
| Python | app.py |

## Continuous deployment using GitHub

To enable continuous deployment with GitHub, navigate to the **App Service** page for your bot in the Azure portal.

1. Click **Deployment Center** > **GitHub** > **Authorize**.

   ![Continuos deployment](~/media/azure-bot-build/azure-deployment.png)

   1. In the browser window that opens up, click **Authorize AzureAppService**.

      ![Azure Github Permission](~/media/azure-bot-build/azure-deployment-github.png)

   1. After authorizing the **AzureAppService**, go back to **Deployment Center** in the Azure portal.

1. Click **Continue**.

      > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
      > ![Continue to build provider](~/media/azure-bot-build/azure-deployment-continue.png)

1. On the **Build provider** page, select the build provider you want to use and click **Continue**.

1. On the **Configure** page, enter the required information and click **Continue**. The information required will depend on which source control service and build provider you chose.

1. On the **Summary** page, review the settings and then click **Finish**.

At this point, continuous deployment with GitHub is set up. New commits in the selected repository and branch now deploy continuously into your App Service app. You can track the commits and deployments on the **Deployment Center** page.

## Disable continuous deployment

While your bot is configured for continuous deployment, you may not use the online code editor to make changes to your bot. If you want to use the online code editor, you can temporarily disable continuous deployment.

To disable continuous deployment, do the following:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), go to your bot's **All App Service settings** blade and click **Deployment Center**.
1. Click **Disconnect** to disable continuous deployment. To re-enable continuous deployment, repeat the steps from the appropriate sections above.

## Additional resources

- For more information about continuous deployment in Azure, see  [continuous deployment to Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/deploy-continuous-deployment).
- When you use GitHub actions for the build provider, a workflow is created in your repository. You can learn more about using [GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/en/actions) on the GitHub site.
