# Integrate your bot with a web browser

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-v4](includes/applies-to-v4-current.md)]

Some scenarios require more than just a bot to fulfill a requirement. A bot may need to send the user to a web browser to complete a task and then resume the conversation with the user after the task has been completed.

## Authentication and authorization
If a bot wants the ability to read the user's calendar in Office 365, or perhaps even create appointments on behalf of that user, the user must first authenticate with Microsoft [Azure Active Directory](/azure/active-directory) and authorize the bot to access the user's calendar data. The bot will redirect the user to a web browser to complete the authentication and authorization tasks, and then will subsequently resume the conversation with the user.

## Security and compliance
Security and compliance requirements often restrict the type of information that a bot can exchange with a user. In some cases, it may be necessary for the user to send/receive data outside of the current conversation. For example, if a user wants to execute a payment using a third-party payment provider, a credit card number should not be specified within the context of the conversation. Instead, the bot will direct the user to a web browser to complete the payment process, and then will subsequently resume the conversation with the user.

This article explores the process of facilitating a user's transition from bot to web browser, and back again.

## Bot to web browser, and back again

This diagram shows the high-level flow for integration between bot and web browser.

![Bot to web interaction](~/media/bot-service-design-pattern-integrate-browser/bot-to-web1.png)

Consider each step of the flow:

1. <a id="generate-hyperlink"></a>The bot generates and displays a hyperlink that will redirect the user to a website. The hyperlink typically includes data via querystring parameters on the target URL that specify information about the context of the current conversation, such as conversation ID, channel ID, and user ID in the channel.

2. The user clicks the hyperlink and is redirected to the target URL within a web browser.

3. The bot enters a state awaiting communication from the website to indicate that the website flow is complete.  
   > [!TIP]
   > Design this flow so that the bot will not permanently remain in the 'waiting' state if
   > the user never completes the website flow. In other words, if the user abandons the web
   > browser and starts communicating with the bot again, the bot should acknowledge, not [ignore](~/bot-service-design-navigation.md#the-mysterious-bot)
   > that input.

4. The user completes the necessary task(s) via the web browser. This could be an OAuth flow or any sequence of events required by the scenario at hand.

5. <a id="generate-magic-number"></a>When the user completes the website flow, the website generates a '[magic number](#verify-identity)' and instructs the user to copy the value and paste it back into the conversation with the bot.

6. <a id="signal-to-bot"></a>The website [signals to the bot](#website-signal-to-bot) that the user has completed the website flow. It communicates the 'magic number' to the bot and provides any other relevant data. For example, in the case of an OAuth flow, the website would provide an access token to the bot.

7. The user returns to the bot and pastes the 'magic number' into the chat. The bot validates that 'magic number' provided by the user matches the expected value, verifying that the current user is the same user who previously clicked the hyperlink to initiate the website flow.

### <a id="verify-identity"></a> Verifying user identity using the 'magic number'

The generation of a 'magic number' during the bot-to-website flow ([step 5](#generate-magic-number) above) enables the bot to subsequently verify that the user who initiated the website flow is indeed the user for whom it was intended.

For example, if a bot is conducting a group chat with multiple users, any one of them could have clicked the hyperlink to initiate the website flow. Without the 'magic number' validation process, the bot has no way of knowing which user completed the flow. One user could authenticate and inject access tokens in another user's session.

> [!WARNING]
> This isn't just a risk within group chats. Without the 'magic number' validation process, anyone who obtains the hyperlink to launch the website flow can spoof a user's identity.

The magic number should be a random number generated using a strong cryptography library. For an example of the generation process in C#, see the [code](https://github.com/MicrosoftDX/botauth/tree/master/CSharp) within the [BotAuth library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/BotAuth).

BotAuth enables bots that are built in Microsoft Bot Framework to implement  the bot-to-website flow to authenticate a user in a website and then to subsequently use the access token  that was generated from the authentication process.  Since BotAuth doesn't make any assumptions about the channel's capabilities, such flows should function well with most channels.

> [!NOTE]
> The need for the 'magic number' validation process should be deprecated as channels build their own embedded web views.

### <a id="website-signal-to-bot"></a> How does the website 'signal' the bot?

When the bot [generates the hyperlink](#generate-hyperlink) that the user will click to initiate the website flow, 
it includes information via the querystring parameters in the target URL about the context of the current conversation, such as conversation ID, channel ID, and user ID in the channel. The website can subsequently use this information to read and write state variables for that user or conversation using the Bot Framework SDK or REST APIs. See [step 6](#signal-to-bot) above for an example of how the website 'signals' to the bot that the website flow is complete.

## Sample code

As described in this article, the [BotAuth library](https://github.com/MicrosoftDX/botauth) enables OAuth flows to be bound to bots that are built using .NET and Node in the Microsoft Bot Framework.
