# Connect a bot to Kik

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-v4](includes/applies-to-v4-current.md)]

>[!NOTE]
> As of March 2022, the Kik messaging app no longer accepts new bot publishing requests. This means that you can continue to develop existing bots connected to the Kik channel, but Kik will limit how many users can access to your bot.
