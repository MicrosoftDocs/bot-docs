You can configure your bot to communicate with people using the Kik messaging app.

## Install Kik on your phone

If you don't have Kik installed on your phone, install it via your phone's app store or at [the Kik website](https://www.kik.com/). You'll need to use an existing Kik user account or sign up for an new account.
