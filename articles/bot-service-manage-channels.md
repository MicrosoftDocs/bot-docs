# Connect a bot to channels

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-v4](includes/applies-to-v4-current.md)]

A channel is a connection between communication applications and a bot. A bot, registered with Azure, uses channels to facilitate the communication with users.

You can configure a bot to connect to any of the standard channels such as Alexa, Facebook Messenger, and Slack. For more information, see [Bot channels registration](bot-service-quickstart-registration.md).

In addition to the provided channels, you can also connect a bot to your communication application using **Direct Line** as the channel.

The Bot Framework allows you to develop a bot in a channel-agnostic way by normalizing messages that the bot sends to a channel. This involves the following:

- Convert the messages from the Bot Framework schema into the channel's schema.
- If the channel does not support all aspects of the Bot Framework schema, the Bot Connector service tries to convert the message to a format that the channel does support. For example, if the bot sends a message that contains a card with action buttons to the email channel, the connector may send the card as an image and include the actions as links in the message's text.
- For most channels, you must provide channel configuration information to run a bot on the channel. Most channels require that a bot have an account on the channel. Others, like Facebook Messenger, require a bot to have an application registered with the channel also.

To configure a bot to connect to a channel, complete the following steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Select the bot that you want to configure.
3. In the Bot Service blade, click **Channels** under **Bot Management**.
4. Click the icon of the channel you want to add to your bot.

After you've configured the channel, users on that channel can start using your bot.
