    questions:
      - question: Why did Microsoft develop the Bot Framework?
        answer: |
          We created the Bot Framework to make it easier for developers to build and connect great bots to users, wherever they converse,
          including on Microsoft's premier channels.

      - question:  How can I migrate Azure Bot Service from one region to another?
        answer: |
          Azure Bot Service does not support region move. It's a global service that is not tied to any specific region.

      - question: How to run a bot offline?
        answer: |
          <!-- WIP -->
          Before talking about the use of a bot offline, meaning a bot not deployed on Azure or on some other host services but on premises, let's clarify a few points.
          - A bot is a web service that does not have a UI, so the user must interact with it via other means, in the form of channels,
          which use the [Bot Framework Service](rest-api/bot-framework-rest-connector-concepts.md).
          The connector functions as a *proxy* to relay messages between a client and the bot.
          - The **connector** is a global application hosted on Azure nodes and spread geographically for availability and scalability.
          - You use the [Bot Channel Registration](bot-service-quickstart-registration.md) to register the bot with the connector.

          >[!NOTE]
          > The bot must have its endpoint publicly reachable by the connector.

          You can run a bot offline with limited capabilities. For example, if you want to use a bot offline that has LUIS capability,
          you must build a container for the bot, and required tools, and a container for LUIS. Both connected via Docker Compose bridged network.
          This is a "partial" offline solution because a Cognitive Services container needs periodic online connection.

          > [!NOTE]
          > The QnA service is not supported in a bot running offline.

          For more information, see:

          - [Container support in Azure Cognitive Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-container-support)

      - question: What is the v4 SDK?
        answer: |
          Bot Framework v4 SDK builds on the feedback and learnings from the prior Bot Framework SDK versions.
          It introduces the right levels of abstraction while enabling rich set of components as the bot building blocks.
          You can start with a simple bot and grow it in sophistication using a modular and extensible framework.
          See also [What's new with Bot Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet#whats-new-with-bot-framework) on GitHub.

      - question: Bot Framework SDK Version 3 Lifetime Support and Deprecation Notice
        answer: |
          Microsoft Bot Framework SDK V4 was released in September 2018, and since then we have shipped a few dot-release improvements.
          As announced previously, the V3 SDK is being retired. Accordingly, there will be no more development in V3 repositories.
          **Existing V3 bot workloads will continue to run without interruption. We have no plans to disrupt any running workloads**.

          As mentioned, Bot Builder SDK V3 bots continue to run and be supported by Azure Bot Service.
          Bot Builder SDK V3 will only be supported  for critical security bug fixes, connector, and protocol layer compatibility updates.

          All new features and capabilities are developed exclusively on [Bot Framework SDK V4](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-sdk).
          Customers are encouraged to migrate their bots to V4 as soon as possible.

          We highly recommend that you start migrating your V3 bots to V4. In order to support this migration we have produced migration documentation
          and will provide extended support for migration initiatives (via standard channels such as Stack Overflow and Microsoft Customer Support).

          ### Azure Bot Service
          1. The Azure Bot Service will continue to support the running of V3 bots with no planned end of life, and any running bots will not be disrupted.
          1. Channels will remain compatible with V3 with no disruption or end of life plan.
          1. Creation of new V3 bots is disabled on the portal; however, expert users who wish to deploy their V3 bots independently through other services (such as another web app service) can do so.

          ### SDK and Tools
          1.    We will not be updating the V3 SDK for the foreseeable future, except to apply critical security fixes and to add a skills connector to allow V4 bots to call legacy V3 bots.
          2.    SDKs and tools development is exclusively on V4 with no V3 work done or planned (hence we're already "there").
          3.    We do not prevent anyone from running old tools to manage their V3 bots.
