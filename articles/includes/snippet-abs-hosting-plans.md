Bot Service offers two different hosting plans for bots. Converting bot source code from one plan to the other is a manual process.   

## App Service plan

A bot that uses an App Service plan is a standard Azure web app you can set to allocate a predefined capacity with predictable costs and scaling. With a bot that uses this hosting plan, you can:

* Edit bot source code online using an advanced in-browser code editor.
* Download, debug, and re-publish your C# bot using Visual Studio.
* Set up continuous deployment easily for Visual Studio Online and Github.
* Use sample code prepared for the Bot Framework SDK.

## Consumption plan

A bot that uses a Consumption plan is a serverless bot that runs on <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkID=747839" target="_blank">Azure Functions</a>, and uses the pay-per-run Azure Functions pricing. A bot that uses this hosting plan can scale to handle huge traffic spikes. You can edit bot source code online using a basic in-browser code editor.
