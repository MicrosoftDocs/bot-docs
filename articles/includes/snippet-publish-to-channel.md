### Skype

>[!NOTE]
> As of October 31, 2019 the Skype channel no longer accepts new Bot publishing requests. This means that you can continue to develop bots using the Skype channel, but your bot will be limited to 100 users. You will not be able to publish your bot to a larger audience. Current Skype bots will continue to run uninterrupted. Read more about [why some features are not available in Skype anymore](https://support.skype.com/faq/fa12091/why-are-some-features-not-available-in-skype-anymore).

Bots are published to Skype from the [configuration page](~/bot-service-channel-connect-skype.md). Publishing a bot submits it for review. Before review, the bot is limited to 100 contacts. Approved bots do not have limited contacts and you may opt to have the bot included in the Skype bot directory.

### Skype for Business

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Skype for Business Online will retire on July 31, 2021. Skype for Business Online customers should see no change to the service before the retirement date. Read [Skype for Business Online to Be Retired](https://aka.ms/skype-business-announcement) for more details.

Skype for Business bots are registered with a [Skype for Business Online tenant](https://msdn.microsoft.com/skype/Skype-For-Business-Bot-Framework/docs/overview) by a Tenant Administrator.

To view the status of a review, open the bot in the [Bot Framework Portal](https://dev.botframework.com/) and click **Channels**. If the bot is not approved, the result will link to the reason why. After making the required changes, resubmit the bot for review.
