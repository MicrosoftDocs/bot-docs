Verify the deployment of your bot by using the [Bot Framework Emulator](~/debug-bots-emulator.md). 

Enter the bot's HTTPS endpoint into the address bar of the Emulator. 
If you built your bot with the Bot Builder SDK, the endpoint should end with */api/messages*
Example: `https://<appname>.azurewebsites.net/api/messages`
