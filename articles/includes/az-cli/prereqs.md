To use the Azure CLI, you need:

- An Azure account that has an active subscription. [Create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- An install of the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
  - For _C#, JavaScript, and Python_ bots, use the _latest version_ of the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/).
  - For _Java_ bots, use Azure CLI _version 2.29.2_. Some steps won't work with later versions of the CLI.
