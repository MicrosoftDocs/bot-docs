To use the Azure CLI to provision and publish bots, you need:

- An Azure account that has an active subscription. [Create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- An [install of the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

  For your programming language, use the following version of the Azure CLI.

  | Python            | 2.39.0 or later |
