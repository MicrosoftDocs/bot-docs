> [!TIP]
> The Azure _Web App Bot_ and _Bot Channels Registration_ resource types are deprecated.
> Resources configured and deployed prior to deprecation will continue to work.
> Bots created from a VSIX or Yeoman template from SDK version 4.14.1.2 or later contain ARM templates that will generate an Azure Bot resource.
