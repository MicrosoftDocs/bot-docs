> [!TIP]
> New _Web App Bot_ and _Bot Channels Registration_ resources can't be created; however, any such existing resources that are configured and deployed will continue to work.
> Bots created from a VSIX or Yeoman template from SDK version 4.14.1.2 or later contain ARM templates that will generate an Azure Bot resource.
