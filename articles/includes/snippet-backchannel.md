The <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-WebChat" target="_blank">open source web chat control</a>
communicates with bots by using the [Direct Line API](../rest-api/bot-framework-rest-direct-line-3-0-concepts.md#client-libraries),
which allows `activities` to be sent back and forth between client and bot.
The most common type of activity is `message`, but there are other types as well.
For example, the activity type `typing` indicates that a user is typing or that the bot is working to compile a response.

You can use the backchannel mechanism to exchange information between client and bot without presenting it to the user by setting the activity type to `event`. The web chat control will automatically ignore any activities where `type="event"`.
