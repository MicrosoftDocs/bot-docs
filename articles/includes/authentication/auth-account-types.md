> When creating the app, in the section **Supports account types**, choose one of the following multi-tenant types options:
>
> |Type|Description|
> |-------|-------|
> |Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD - Multitenant)|This option provides less exposure by restricting access and in case OAuth is not supported.|
> |Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (for example, Xbox, Outlook.com)|This option is well-suited to support OAuth and bot authentication.|
