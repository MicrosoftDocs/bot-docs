The [Connector](./dotnet/bot-builder-dotnet-concepts.md#connector) uses an [Activity](https://docs.botframework.com/csharp/builder/sdkreference/dc/d2f/class_microsoft_1_1_bot_1_1_connector_1_1_activity.html) object to pass information back and forth between bot and channel (user). The most common type of activity is **message**, but there are other activity types that can be used to communicate various types of information to a bot or channel.
