- If you prefer, [install](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) the Azure CLI to run CLI reference commands.

  - If you're using a local installation, sign in to the Azure CLI using the [az login](/cli/azure/reference-index#az-login) command. To finish the authentication process, follow the steps displayed in your terminal. For more sign-in options, see [Sign in with the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli).

  - When you're prompted, install Azure CLI extensions on first use. For more information about extensions, see [Use extensions with the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/azure-cli-extensions-overview).

  - Run [az version](/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-version) to find the currently installed version and dependent libraries. To upgrade to the latest version, run [az upgrade](/cli/azure/reference-index?#az-upgrade).
