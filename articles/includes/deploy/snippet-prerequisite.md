- If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
- A C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, or Python bot that you have developed on your local machine. If you don't have a bot to deploy yet, see [Create a bot with the Bot Framework SDK](../../bot-service-quickstart-create-bot.md).
- Latest version of the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
- Familiarity with [Azure CLI and ARM templates](/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-overview).
- For Java only, [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).
