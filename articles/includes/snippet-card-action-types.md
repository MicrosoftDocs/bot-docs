To function correctly, assign an action type to each clickable item on a hero card. This table lists and describes the available action types and what should be in the associated value property.

The `messageBack` card action has a more generalized meaning than the other card actions. See the [Card action](https://github.com/Microsoft/botframework-sdk/blob/main/specs/botframework-activity/botframework-activity.md#card-action) section of the [Activity schema](https://github.com/Microsoft/botframework-sdk/blob/main/specs/botframework-activity/botframework-activity.md) for more information about the `messageBack` and other card action types.
