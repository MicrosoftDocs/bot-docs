<!-- Include under "Start your bot" header in the files:
bot-builder-tutorial-create-basic-bot.md and bot-builder-python-quickstart.md -->

1. From a terminal navigate to the **echo-bot** folder where you saved your bot. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install any required packages to run your bot.

2. Once the packages are installed run `python app.py` to start your bot. You will know your bot is ready to test when you see the last line shown in the screenshot below:

    ![bot running locally](~/media/python/quickstart/bot-running-locally.png)

Copy the last for digits in the address on the last line (usually _3978_) since you will be using them in the next step. You are now ready to start the Emulator.
