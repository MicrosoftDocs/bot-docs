## Send suggested actions

To add suggested actions to a message, set the `suggestedActions` property of the [Activity][Activity] to specify the list of [CardAction][CardAction] objects that represent the buttons to be presented to the user. 

The following request sends a message that presents three suggested actions to the user. In this example request, `https://smba.trafficmanager.net/apis` represents the base URI; the base URI for requests that your bot issues may be different. For details about setting the base URI, see [API Reference](bot-framework-rest-connector-api-reference.md#base-uri).

```http
POST https://smba.trafficmanager.net/apis/v3/conversations/abcd1234/activities/5d5cdc723
Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json
```

```json
{
    "type": "message",
    "from": {
        "id": "12345678",
        "name": "sender's name"
    },
    "conversation": {
        "id": "abcd1234",
        "name": "conversation's name"
   },
   "recipient": {
        "id": "1234abcd",
        "name": "recipient's name"
    },
    "text": "I have colors in mind, but need your help to choose the best one.",
    "inputHint": "expectingInput",
    "suggestedActions": {
        "actions": [
            {
                "type": "imBack",
                "title": "Blue",
                "value": "Blue"
            },
            {
                "type": "imBack",
                "title": "Red",
                "value": "Red"
            },
            {
                "type": "imBack",
                "title": "Green",
                "value": "Green"
            }
        ]
    },
    "replyToId": "5d5cdc723"
}
```

When the user taps one of the suggested actions, the bot will receive a message from the user that contains the `value` of the corresponding action.
