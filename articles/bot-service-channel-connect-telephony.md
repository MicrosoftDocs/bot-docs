# Connect a bot to Telephony (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-v4](includes/applies-to-v4-current.md)]

The Telephony channel leverages the power of the Microsoft Bot Framework, in combination with Azure Communication Services and Microsoft Speech services, to enable phone calling capabilities in a bot.

See the [Bot Framework Telephony project](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-telephony#readme) for details.
