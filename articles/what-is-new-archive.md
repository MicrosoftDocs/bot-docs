**Insiders**: Want to try new features as soon as possible? You can download the nightly Insiders build [[C#](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet/blob/master/UsingMyGet.md)] [[JS](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-js/blob/master/UsingMyGet.md)] [[Python](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-python/blob/master/UsingTestPyPI.md)] [[CLI](https://github.com/Microsoft/botframework-cli#nightly-builds)] and try the latest updates as soon as they are available. And for the latest Bot Framework news, updates, and content, follow us on Twitter @msbotframework!

### Skills
[Skills](v4sdk/skills-conceptual.md) have been updated to work with adaptive dialogs, and both adaptive and traditional dialogs will now accept all types of activities.

The skill manifest schema has been updated to [version 2.1](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-sdk/tree/master/schemas/skills). Improvements in this version include the ability to declare & share your language models, and define any type of activity that your skill can receive.

This release also includes authentication improvements with skills, including using SSO with dialogs, and OAuth without needing a magic code in WebChat and DirectLine.

### Microsoft Teams
We continue to focus on making sure all the Teams-specific APIs are fully supported across our SDKs. This release brings full support for Microsoft Teams APIs in the preview [Java SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-java), including [samples](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-java/tree/master/samples).

The `OnTeamsMemberAdded` event in the activity handler has been updated to use the get single member endpoint under the covers, which should significantly reduce latency and reliability of this event in large teams.

The `TeamsChannelAccount` object has been updated to include `userRole` (one of owner, member, or guest) and `tenantId` (for the user's tenantId).

### Bot Telemetry
Bots now capture Page View events, native to Application Insights, whenever a dialog is started. This allows you to use the User Flows dashboard in Application Insights to see how users move through your bot, between dialogs and where they drop out.

![Telemetry In AppInsights](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/botframework-sdk/master/docs/media/UserFlowsAppInsights.jpg?raw=true)

### Adaptive Dialogs
We're also excited to make [Adaptive Dialogs](v4sdk/bot-builder-adaptive-dialog-introduction.md) generally available in C# and as a preview release in JavaScript!

Adaptive Dialogs, which underpin the dialog design and management authoring features found in Bot Framework Composer, enable developers to dynamically update conversation flow based on context and events. This is especially useful when dealing with more sophisticated conversation requirements, such as context switches and interruptions.  Bot Framework Skills can now also leverage Adaptive Dialogs.

Adaptive Dialogs also now support Telemetry. Data from Adaptive Dialogs, including  triggers, actions and recognizers now flow into your Azure Application Insights instance.

### CLI tools for Adaptive Dialogs
[CLI tools](https://github.com/Microsoft/botframework-cli) for Adaptive Dialogs, Language Generation, QnaMaker and Luis Cross-train - new ability to merge and validate adaptive schema assets, augment qna and lu files, create/ update/ replace/ train/ publish LUIS and or QnA maker application and Language Generation templates manipulation.

New CLI Tools were added for management of Adaptive Dialogs.
- [bf-dialog](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-cli/tree/master/packages/dialog#relevant-docs) supports merging dialog schema files and verify file format correctness.
- [bf-luis](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-cli/tree/master/packages/luis#relevant-docs) Adds commands to augment lu files and create/ update/ replace/ train/ publish LUIS
- [bf-qnamaker](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-cli/tree/master/packages/qnamaker#relevant-docs) Adds commands to augment qna files and create/ update/ replace/ train/ publish QnAMaker
- [bf-lg](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-cli/tree/master/packages/lg#relevant-docs) Parse, collate, expand and translate lg files.

### Language Generation

LG is Generally Available (GA) on both the C# and JS Platforms.

[Language Generation (LG)](v4sdk/bot-builder-concept-language-generation.md) enables you to define multiple variations of a phrase, execute simple expressions based on context, and refer to conversational memory. At the core of language generation lies template expansion and entity substitution. You can provide one-of variation for expansion as well as conditionally expanding a template. The output from language generation can be a simple text string or multi-line response or a complex object payload that a layer above language generation will use to construct a complete activity. The Bot Framework Composer natively supports language generation to produce output activities using the LG templating system.

You can use Language Generation to:
* Achieve a coherent personality, tone of voice for your bot.
* Separate business logic from presentation.
* Include variations and sophisticated composition for any of your bot's replies.
* Construct cards, suggested actions and attachments using a structured response template.

Language Generation is achieved through:

* A markdown based .lg file that contains the templates and their composition.
Full access to the current bot's memory so you can data bind language to the state of memory.
* Parser and runtime libraries that help achieve runtime resolution.

### Adaptive Expressions
[Adaptive Expressions](v4sdk/bot-builder-concept-adaptive-expressions.md) are Generally Available (GA) on both the C# and JS Platforms.

Bots use expressions to evaluate the outcome of a condition based on runtime information available in memory to the dialog or the Language Generation system. These evaluations determine how your bot reacts to user input and other factors that impact bot functionality.

Adaptive expressions were created to address this core need as well as provide an adaptive expression language that can used with the Bot Framework SDK and other conversational AI components, like [Bot Framework Composer](https:/docs.microsoft.com/composer/), Language Generation, Adaptive dialogs, and [Adaptive Cards](https://docs.microsoft.com/adaptive-cards/).

An adaptive expression can contain one or more explicit values, pre-built functions or custom functions. Consumers of adaptive expressions also have the capability to inject additional supported functions. For example, all Language Generation templates are available as functions as well as additional functions that are only available within that component's use of adaptive expressions.

### Authentication Improvements
We added support for single sign-on while using Expect Replies. This applies to SSO performed between a pair of bots: host and a skill.

For Bot Identification we've added the ability to specify `sendx5c` parameter for certificate authentication. This feature was requested by customers and allows for more flexibility when using cert auth.

Additional Sovereign Clouds are supported.

### Generated Dialogs - Early Preview

The Bot Framework has a rich collection of conversational building blocks, but
creating a bot that feels natural to converse with requires understanding and
coordinating across language understanding, language generation and dialog
management. To simplify this process and capture best practices, we've created
the [bf-generate](https://github.com/microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/blob/master/experimental/generation/generator/README.md) plugin for the [BotFramework CLI tool](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-cli). The
generated dialogs make use of event-driven adaptive dialogs with a rich and
evolving set of capabilities including:

- Handle out of order and multiple responses for simple and array properties.
- Add, remove, clear and show properties.
- Support for choosing between ambiguous entity values and entity property mappings.
- Recognizing and mapping for all LUIS prebuilt entities.
- Help function, including auto-help on multiple retries.
- Cancel
- Confirmation

### VS Code Debugger - Early Preview
[Adaptive tools](https://github.com/microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/experimental/adaptive-tool) is a brand new Visual studio code extension you can use to create/ validate .lu and .lg documents as well as debug declaratively defined adaptive dialogs. This extension provides rich authoring & editing capabilities for .lu and .lg file formats including syntax highlighting, auto-suggest and auto-complete.

We anticipate adding an early preview to the VS Marketplace shortly after this release.

### Bot Builder Community
During this release, the Bot Builder Community has further raised the bar by adding more features, more adapters, and fixing more bugs.

1. A revised C# [Alexa Adapter](https://github.com/BotBuilderCommunity/botbuilder-community-dotnet/tree/develop/libraries/Bot.Builder.Community.Adapters.Alexa) and [Google Home Adapter]() Re-built from the ground up, starting with Alexa, to allow the adapters to be consumed by Azure Bot Service and made available as channels. Improvements include better native activity type mapping, improved markdown rendering and support for more complex scenarios (such as merging multiple outgoing activities).

2. A new C# [Zoom Adapter](https://github.com/BotBuilderCommunity/botbuilder-community-dotnet/tree/develop/libraries/Bot.Builder.Community.Adapters.Zoom) that supports Zoom 1:1 and channel chat capabilities and converts them to native BF activity types. With it, you can subscribe to any event that Zoom supports, with full support for Zoom interactive messages and rich message templates. (The adapter translates Zoom events into BF event activities.)

3. A [RingCentral Adapter](https://github.com/BotBuilderCommunity/botbuilder-community-dotnet/tree/develop/libraries/Bot.Builder.Community.Adapters.RingCentral). The [RingCentral](https://www.ringcentral.com/) Engage adapter allows you to add an additional endpoint to your bot for [RingCentral Engage Digital Platform](https://www.ringcentral.com/digital-customer-engagement.html) integration. The RingCentral endpoint can be used in conjunction with other channels meaning, for example, you can have a bot exposed on out of the box channels such as Facebook and Teams, but also integrated as an [RingCentral Engage Digital Source SDK](https://support.ringcentral.com/s/article/RingCentral-Engage-Digital-Introduction?language=en_US) into RingCentral.

### Bot Framework Composer

[Bot Framework Composer](https://docs.microsoft.com/composer/) is Generally Available (GA) on the [Windows](https://aka.ms/composer-windows-download) | [macOS](https://aka.ms/composer-mac-download) | [Linux](https://aka.ms/composer-linux-download) platforms.

Bot Framework Composer is a visual authoring canvas for developers and multi-disciplinary teams to build bots. It is an open source conversational application based on the Microsoft Bot Framework SDK. Within Composer, you will find everything you need to build a sophisticated conversational experience:

* A visual editing canvas for conversation flow.
* In-context editing for language understanding.
* Tools to train and manage language understanding (such as LUIS and QnA Maker) components.
* Powerful language generation and templating systems.
* A ready-to-use bot run-time executable.

<a name="V4-whats-new"></a>
## Bot Framework SDK (New! In preview)

- [Adaptive Dialog][47] | [docs][48] | [C# samples][49]: Adaptive Dialogs enable developers to build conversations that can be dynamically changed as the conversation progresses.  Traditionally developers have mapped out the entire flow of a conversation up front, which limits the flexibility of the conversation.  Adaptive dialogs allow them to be more flexible, to respond to changes in context and insert new steps or entire sub-dialogs into the conversation as it progresses.

- [Language Generation][43] | [docs][44] | [C# samples][45]: Language Generation; which allows the developer to extract the embedded strings from their code and resource files and manage them through a Language Generation runtime and file format.  Language Generation enable customers to define multiple variations on a phrase, execute simple expressions based on context, refer to conversational memory, and over time will enable us to bring additional capabilities all leading to a more natural conversational experience.

- [Common Expression Language][40] | [api][41]: Both Adaptive dialogs and Language Generation rely on and use a common expression language to power bot conversations.

## Botkit
[Botkit][100] is a developer tool and SDK for building chat bots, apps and custom integrations for major messaging platforms. Botkit bots `hear()` triggers, `ask()` questions and `say()` replies. Developers can use this syntax to build dialogs - now cross compatible with the latest version of Bot Framework SDK.

In addition, Botkit brings with it 6 platform adapters allowing Javascript bot applications to communicate directly with messaging platforms: [Slack][102], [Webex Teams][103], [Google Hangouts][104], [Facebook Messenger][105], [Twilio][106], and [Web chat][107].

Botkit is part of Microsoft Bot Framework and is released under the [MIT Open Source license][101]

## Bot Framework Solutions (New! In preview)

### Language Understanding
A machine learning-based service to build natural language experiences. Quickly create enterprise-ready, custom models that continuously improve. [Language Understanding Service(LUIS)][30] allows your application to understand what a person wants in their own words.

<a name="LUIS-whats-new"></a>

- **New! Roles, External Entities and Dynamic Entities**: LUIS has added several features that let developers extract more detailed information from text, so users can now build more intelligent solutions with less effort. LUIS also extended roles to all entity types, which allows the same entities to be classified with different subtypes based on context. Developers now have more granular control of what they can do with LUIS, including being able to identify and update models at runtime through dynamic lists and external entities. Dynamic lists are used to append to list entities at prediction time, permitting user-specific information to get matched exactly. Separate supplementary entity extractors are run with external entities, and that information can be appended to LUIS as strong signals for other models.

- **New! Analytics dashboard**: LUIS is releasing a more detailed, visually-rich comprehensive analytics dashboard. Its user-friendly design highlights common issues most users face when designing applications, by providing simple explanations on how to resolve them to help users gain more insight into their models' quality, potential data problems, and guidance to adopt best practices.
