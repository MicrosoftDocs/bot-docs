# Deploy a bot to the cloud

After you have built and tested your bots, you need to deploy it to the cloud.

> [!NOTE]
> Bots built using the Azure Bot Service do not need to be registered or deployed.
> Bot registration and deployment are handled as part of the Azure Bot Service bot creation process.

## Deploy your bot to the cloud

Before others can use your bot, you must deploy it to the cloud. You can deploy it to Azure or to any other cloud service. These articles describe various techniques for deploying your bot to Azure: 

- [Deploy from a local git repository](~/deploy-bot-local-git.md) using continuous integration
- [Deploy from GitHub](~/deploy-bot-github.md) using continuous integration
- [Deploy from Visual Studio](~/deploy-bot-visual-studio.md)

## Connect the bot to one or more channels

After registering the bot with the Bot Framework and deployed it bot to the cloud, [configure the bot to connect on one or more channels](~/portal-configure-channels.md).

## Publish a bot
The publishing process is different for each channel.
