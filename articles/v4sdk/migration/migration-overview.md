# Migration overview

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-v4](../../includes/applies-to-v4-current.md)]

The Bot Framework SDK v4 builds on customers' feedback and the learning experience from previous SDKs. It introduces the right levels of abstraction while enabling a flexible bot components architecture. Among other things, this allows you to create a simple bot and then expand its sophistication using the modularity and extensibility of the Bot Framework SDK v4.

> [!NOTE]
> The Bot Framework SDK v4 strives to keep simple things simple and makes complex things possible.

An open approach has been adopted so that the Bot Framework v4 SDK has been built with the cooperation from the community. When you first submit a Pull Request, a [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com/) (CLA) automatically determines whether you need a license. You will only need to do this once across all repositories. Typically, there is a time interval to establish a set of objectives to achieve.

## What happens to bots built using SDK v3

The Bot Framework SDK v3 will be retired but existing V3 bot workloads will continue to run without interruption. For more information, see: [Bot Framework SDK Version 3 Lifetime Support](../../bot-service-resources-faq-availability.md#bot-framework-sdk-version-3-lifetime-support-and-deprecation-notice).

We highly recommend that you start migrating your V3 bots to V4. In order to support this migration we have produced related documentation and will provide extended support for migration initiatives via standard channels.

If you can not migrate from a v3 bot to a v4 bot immediately, you may still want to take advantage of the additional functionality available in the v4 SDK. You can convert your v3 bot to a skill, and create a skill consumer bot based on the v4 SDK to pass messages to your v3 bot. For more information, see how to [convert a v3 bot to a skill](convert-to-skill-overview.md).

## Advantages

## What's changed

The Bot Framework SDK v4 supports the same underlying Bot Framework Service as v3. However, v4 is a refactoring of the previous SDKs to allow more flexibility and control over a bot's creation. This includes the following:

- Introduced a bot adapter
  - The adapter is part of the activity processing stack
  - It handles Bot Framework authentication and initializes context for each turn
  - It manages incoming and outgoing traffic between a channel and your bot's turn handler, encapsulating the calls to the Bot Framework Connector service
  - For more details, see [How bots work](../bot-builder-basics.md)
- Refactored state management
  - State data is no longer automatically available within a bot
  - State is now managed via state management objects and property accessors
  - For more details, see [Managing state](../bot-builder-concept-state.md)
- Introduced new Dialogs library
  - v3 dialogs need to be rewritten for the new dialog library
  - For more details, see [Dialogs library](../bot-builder-concept-dialog.md)

## What's involved in migration work

- Update setup logic
- Port any critical user state
  - Note: sensitive user state cannot be kept in a bot state, instead store in separate storage under your control
- Port bot and dialog logic (see language-specific topics for more details)

### Migration estimation worksheet

The following worksheets can guide you in estimating your migration workload. In the **Occurrences** column replace *count* with your actual numeric value. In the **T Shirt** column enter values such as: *Small*, *Medium*, *Large* based on your estimation.

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

The Bot Framework SDK v4 is based on the same underlying REST API as v3. However, v4 is a refactoring of the previous version of the SDK to allow more flexibility and control over the bots.

We recommend migrating to .NET Core, since the performance is very much improved.
However, some existing V3 bots are using external libraries that do not have a .NET Core equivalent. In this case, the Bot Framework SDK v4 can be used with .NET Framework version 4.6.1 or later. You can find an example at [corebot](https://github.com/microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/samples/csharp_webapi) location.

When migrating a project from v3 to v4, you can choose one of these options: convert in place for **.NET Framework** or port to a new project for **.NET Core**.

#### .NET Framework

- Update and install NuGet packages
- Update your Global.asax.cs file
- Update your MessagesController class
- Convert your dialogs

For more information, see [Migrate a .NET v3 bot to a .NET Framework v4 bot](conversion-framework.md).

#### .NET Core

- Create the new project using a template

 [!INCLUDE [VSIX templates](~/includes/vsix-templates-versions.md)]

- Install additional NuGet packages as necessary
- Personalize your bot, update your Startup.cs file, and update your controller class
- Update your bot class
- Copy over and update your dialogs and models

For more information, see [Migrate a .NET v3 bot to a .NET Core v4 bot](conversion-core.md).

# [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

The **Bot Framework JavaScript SDK v4** introduces several fundamental changes on how bots are authored. These changes affect the syntax for developing bots in JavaScript, especially around creating bot objects, defining dialogs, and coding event handling logic. The Bot Framework SDK v4 is based on the same underlying REST API as v3. However, v4 is a refactoring of the previous version of the SDK to allow more flexibility and control over the bots, in particular:

- Dialogs and bot instances have been further decoupled. In v3, dialogs were registered directly in the bot's constructor. In v4, you now pass dialogs into bot instances as arguments, providing greater compositional flexibility
- v4 provides an `ActivityHandler` class, which helps automate the handling of different types of activities, such as message, conversation update, and event activities
- For NodeJS bot migration, you need to create a new v4 NodeJS bot in either TypeScript or JavaScript. Recreate the bot logic using the new v4 constructs described in the related migration documentation

#### Migrate from v3 to v4

- Create the new project and add dependencies
- Update the entry point and define constants
- Create the dialogs, re-implementing them using the SDK v4
- Update the bot code to run the dialogs
- Port the `store.js` utility file

For more information, see [Migrate a SDK v3 JavaScript bot to v4](conversion-javascript.md).
