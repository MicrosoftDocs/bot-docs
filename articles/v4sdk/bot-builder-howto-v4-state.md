# Save user and conversation data

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-v4](../includes/applies-to-v4-current.md)]

A bot is inherently stateless. Once your bot is deployed, it may not run in the same process or on the same machine from one turn to the next. However, your bot may need to track the context of a conversation so that it can manage its behavior and remember answers to previous questions. The state and storage features of the Bot Framework SDK allow you to add state to your bot. Bots use state management and storage objects to manage and persist state. The state manager provides an abstraction layer that lets you access state properties using property accessors, independent of the type of underlying storage.

## Prerequisites

- Knowledge of [bot basics](bot-builder-basics.md) and how bots [manage state](bot-builder-concept-state.md) is required.
- The code in this article is based on the **State Management Bot sample**. You'll need a copy of the sample in either [C#](https://aka.ms/statebot-sample-cs), [JavaScript](https://aka.ms/statebot-sample-js) or [Python](https://aka.ms/bot-state-python-sample-code).

## About this sample

Upon receiving user input, this sample checks the stored conversation state to see if this user has previously been prompted to provide their name. If not, the user's name is requested and that input is stored within user state. If so, the name stored within user state is used to converse with the user and their input data, along with the time received and input channel Id, is returned back to the user. The time and channel Id values are retrieved from the user conversation data and then saved to conversation state. The following diagram shows the relationship between the bot, user profile, and conversation data classes.

## Define classes

## [C#](#tab/csharp)

The first step in setting up state management is to define the classes containing the information to manage in the user and conversation state. The example used in this article, defines the following classes:

- In **UserProfile.cs**, you define a `UserProfile` class for the user information that the bot will collect.
- In **ConversationData.cs**, you define a `ConversationData` class to control our conversation state while gathering user information.

The following code examples show the definitions for the `UserProfile` and `ConversationData` classes.

**UserProfile.cs**

[!code-csharp[UserProfile](~/../BotBuilder-Samples/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/45.state-management/UserProfile.cs?range=7-11)]

**ConversationData.cs**

[!code-csharp[ConversationData](~/../BotBuilder-Samples/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/45.state-management/ConversationData.cs?range=6-17)]

## [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

This step is not necessary in JavaScript.

## [Python](#tab/python)

The first step in setting up state management is to define the classes containing the information to manage in the user and conversation state. The example used in this article, defines the following classes:

- The **user_profile.py** contains the `UserProfile` class which stores the user information collected by the bot.
- The **conversation_data.py** contains the `ConversationData` class which controls the conversation state while gathering user information.

The following code examples show the definitions for the `UserProfile` and `ConversationData` classes.

**user_profile.py**

[!code-python[user_profile](~/../botbuilder-samples/samples/python/45.state-management/data_models/user_profile.py?range=5-7)]

**conversation_data.py**

[!code-python[conversation_data](~/../botbuilder-samples/samples/python/45.state-management/data_models/conversation_data.py?range=5-14)]

## Create conversation and user state objects

## [C#](#tab/csharp)

Next, you register `MemoryStorage` that is used to create `UserState` and `ConversationState` objects. The user and conversation state objects are created at `Startup` and dependency injected into the bot constructor. Other services for a bot that are registered are: a credential provider, an adapter, and the bot implementation.

**Startup.cs**

[!code-csharp[ConfigureServices](~/../BotBuilder-Samples/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/45.state-management/Startup.cs?range=24-27)]
[!code-csharp[ConfigureServices](~/../BotBuilder-Samples/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/45.state-management/Startup.cs?range=49-55)]

**Bots/StateManagementBot.cs**

[!code-csharp[Bot constructor](~/../BotBuilder-Samples/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/45.state-management/Bots/StateManagementBot.cs?range=15-22)]

## [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

Next, you register `MemoryStorage` that is then used to create `UserState` and `ConversationState` objects. These are created in **index.js** and consumed when the bot is created.

**index.js**

[!code-javascript[index.js](~/../BotBuilder-Samples/samples/javascript_nodejs/45.state-management/index.js?range=34-40)]

**bots/stateManagementBot.js**

[!code-javascript[bot constructor](~/../BotBuilder-Samples/samples/javascript_nodejs/45.state-management/bots/stateManagementBot.js?range=10-12)]
[!code-javascript[bot constructor](~/../BotBuilder-Samples/samples/javascript_nodejs/45.state-management/bots/stateManagementBot.js?range=17-19)]

## [Python](#tab/python)

Next, you register `MemoryStorage` that is used to create `UserState` and `ConversationState` objects. These are created in **app.py** and consumed when the bot is created.

**app.py**

[!code-python[app.py](~/../botbuilder-samples/samples/python/45.state-management/app.py?range=68-71)]

**bots/state_management_bot.py**

[!code-python[bot constructor](~/../botbuilder-samples/samples/python/45.state-management/bots/state_management_bot.py?range=13-25)]

## Add state property accessors

## [C#](#tab/csharp)

Now you create property accessors using the `CreateProperty` method that provides a handle to the `BotState` object. Each state property accessor allows you to get or set the value of the associated state property. Before you use the state properties, use each accessor to load the property from storage and get it from the state cache. To get the properly scoped key associated with the state property, you call the `GetAsync` method.

**Bots/StateManagementBot.cs**

[!code-csharp[Create accessors](~/../BotBuilder-Samples/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/45.state-management/Bots/StateManagementBot.cs?range=42,45)]

## [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

Now you create property accessors for `UserState` and `ConversationState`. Each state property accessor allows you to get or set the value of the associated state property. You use each accessor to load the associated property from storage and retrieve its current state from cache.

**bots/stateManagementBot.js**

[!code-javascript[Create accessors](~/../BotBuilder-Samples/samples/javascript_nodejs/45.state-management/bots/stateManagementBot.js?range=13-15)]

## [Python](#tab/python)

Now you create property accessors for `UserProfile` and `ConversationData`. Each state property accessor allows you to get or set the value of the associated state property. You use each accessor to load the associated property from storage and retrieve its current state from cache.

**bots/state_management_bot.py**

## Access state from your bot

The preceding section covers the initialization-time steps to add state property accessors to our bot. Now, you can use those accessors at run-time to read and write state information. The sample code below uses the following logic flow:

## [C#](#tab/csharp)

- If userProfile.Name is empty and conversationData.PromptedUserForName is _true_, you retrieve the user name provided and store this within user state.
- If userProfile.Name is empty and conversationData.PromptedUserForName is _false_, you ask for the user's name.
- If userProfile.Name was previously stored, you retrieve message time and channel Id from the user input, echo all data back to the user, and store the retrieved data within conversation state.

**Bots/StateManagementBot.cs**

[!code-csharp[OnMessageActivityAsync](~/../BotBuilder-Samples/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/45.state-management/bots/StateManagementBot.cs?range=38-85)]

Before you exit the turn handler, you use the state management objects' _SaveChangesAsync()_ method to write all state changes back to storage.

**Bots/StateManagementBot.cs**

[!code-csharp[OnTurnAsync](~/../BotBuilder-Samples/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/45.state-management/bots/StateManagementBot.cs?range=24-31)]

## [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

- If userProfile.Name is empty and conversationData.PromptedUserForName is _true_, you retrieve the user name provided and store this within user state.
- If userProfile.Name is empty and conversationData.PromptedUserForName is _false_, you ask for the user's name.
- If userProfile.Name was previously stored, you retrieve message time and channel Id from the user input, echo all data back to the user, and store the retrieved data within conversation state.

**bots/stateManagementBot.js**

[!code-javascript[OnMessage](~/../BotBuilder-Samples/samples/javascript_nodejs/45.state-management/bots/stateManagementBot.js?range=21-58)]

Before you exit each dialog turn, you use the state management objects' _saveChanges()_ method to persist all changes by writing state back out to storage.

**bots/stateManagementBot.js**

[!code-javascript[OnDialog](~/../BotBuilder-Samples/samples/javascript_nodejs/45.state-management/bots/stateManagementBot.js?range=72-81)]

## [Python](#tab/python)

- If `user_profile.name` is empty and `conversation_data.prompted_for_user_name` is *true*, the bot retrieves the name provided by the user and stores it in the user's state.
- If `user_profile.name` is empty and `conversation_data.prompted_for_user_name` is *false*,the bot asks for the user's name.
- If `user_profile.name` was previously stored, the bot retrieves **message time** and **channel Id** from the user input, echoes the data back to the user, and stores the retrieved data in the conversation state.

**bots/state_management_bot.py**

[!code-python[state_message_activity](~/../botbuilder-samples/samples/python/45.state-management/bots/state_management_bot.py?range=47-89)]

Before exiting each dialog turn, the bot uses the state management objects' `save_changes` method to persist all changes by writing state information in the storage.

**bots/state_management_bot.py**

[!code-python[state_storage](~/../botbuilder-samples/samples/python/45.state-management/bots/state_management_bot.py?range=32-36)]

## Test the bot

Download and install the latest [Bot Framework Emulator](https://aka.ms/bot-framework-emulator-readme)

1. Run the sample locally on your machine. If you need instructions, refer to the README file for [C# Sample](https://aka.ms/statebot-sample-cs) or [JS Sample](https://aka.ms/statebot-sample-js).
1. Use the Emulator to test the bot as shown below.

## Additional resources

**Privacy:** If you intend to store user's personal data, you should ensure compliance with [General Data Protection Regulation](https://blog.botframework.com/2018/04/23/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr).

**State management:** All of the state management calls are asynchronous, and last-writer-wins by default. In practice, you should get, set, and save state as close together in your bot as possible.

**Critical business data:** Use bot state to store preferences, user name, or the last thing they ordered, but do not use it to store critical business data. For critical data, [create your own storage components](bot-builder-custom-storage.md) or write directly to [storage](bot-builder-howto-v4-storage.md).

**Recognizer-Text:** The sample uses the Microsoft/Recognizers-Text libraries to parse and validate user input. For more information, see the [overview](https://github.com/Microsoft/Recognizers-Text#microsoft-recognizers-text-overview) page.

## Next steps

Now that you know how to configure state to help you read and write bot data to storage, let's learn how ask the user a series of questions, validate their answers, and save their input.
