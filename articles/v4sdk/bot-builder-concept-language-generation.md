# Language Generation

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-v4](../includes/applies-to-v4-current.md)]

<!-- See [what's new](#Change-Log) for what's new in **4.8.0 RC1** release.-->

Language Generation (LG) allows developers to extract embedded strings from their code and resource files and manage them through a LG runtime and file format. With LG, developers can create a more natural conversation experience by defining multiple variations on a phrase, executing simple expressions based on context, and referring to conversational memory.

LG can be used by developers to:

- achieve a coherent personality, tone of voice for their bot
- separate business logic from presentation
- include variations and sophisticated composition based resolution for any of their bot's replies
- construct speak .vs. display adaptations
- construct cards, suggested actions and attachments

At the core of LG lies template expansion and entity substitution. You can provide one-of variation for expansion as well as conditionally expand a template. The output from LG can be a simple text string, multi-line response, or a complex object payload that a layer above LG will use to construct an [activity][1].

The following is a simple greeting LG template. Notice that all of the greetings reference the user's name in memory with the variable `${user.name}`.

```lg
# greetingTemplate
- Hello ${user.name}, how are you?
- Good morning ${user.name}.It's nice to see you again.
- Good day ${user.name}. What can I do for you today?
```

## LG in action

You can use LG in a variety of ways when developing bots. To start, create one or more [.lg file(s)][3] to cover all possible scenarios where you would use the language generation sub-system with your bot's replies to a user.

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

Make sure you include the language Generation library [`Microsoft.Bot.Builder.LanguageGeneration`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Bot.Builder.LanguageGeneration/). Then parse and load templates in your .lg file by adding the following:

```csharp
    _templates = Templates.ParseFile(fullPath);
```

# [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

Make sure you include the language Generation library [`botbuilder-lg`][15]. Then parse and load templates in your .lg file by adding the following:

```javascript
     let lgTemplates = Templates.parseFile(fullPath);
```

---

When you need template expansion, use `Evaluate` and pass in the relevant template name.

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp
    var lgOutput = _templates.Evaluate(<TemplateName>);
```

# [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

```javascript
    let lgOutput = lgTemplates.evaluate(<TemplateName>);
```

---

If your template needs specific properties to be passed for resolution/expansion, you can pass them when calling  `Evaluate`.

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp
    var lgOutput = _templates.Evaluate("WordGameReply", new { GameName = "MarcoPolo" } );
```

# [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

```javascript
    let lgOutput = lgTemplates.evaluate("WordGameReply", { GameName = "MarcoPolo" } );
```

---

## Multilingual generation and language fallback policy

Your bot might target more than one spoken or display language. You can manage separate instances of the *TemplateEngine*, one per target language. For an example of how to add multiple languages, also known as language fallback, to your bot, see the multi-turn prompt with language fallback sample in [C#](https://aka.ms/csharp-lg-multi-turn-prompt-language-fallback-sample) or [JavaScript](https://aka.ms/js-lg-multi-turn-prompt-language-fallback-sample).

<!--
## Grammar check and correction
The current library does not include any capabilities for grammar check or correction-->

## Expand API

To get all possible expansions of a template, you can use `ExpandTemplate`.

# [C#](#tab/csharp)

```csharp
    var results = lgTemplates.ExpandTemplate("WordGameReply", { GameName = "MarcoPolo" } )
```

# [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

```javascript
    const results = lgTemplates.expandTemplate("WordGameReply", { GameName = "MarcoPolo" } )
```

---

For example, given this LG content:

```lg
# Greeting
- Hi
- Hello

#TimeOfDay
- Morning
- Evening

# FinalGreeting
- ${Greeting()} ${TimeOfDay()}

# TimeOfDayWithCondition
- IF: ${time == 'morning'}
    - ${Greeting()} Morning
- ELSEIF: ${time == 'evening'}
    - ${Greeting()} Evening
- ELSE:
    - ${Greeting()} Afternoon
```

The call `ExpandTemplate("FinalGreeting")` results in four evaluations:

- **Hi Morning**
- **Hi Evening**
- **Hello Morning**
- **Hello Evening**

The call `ExpandTemplate("TimeOfDayWithCondition", new { time = "evening" })` with scope, results in two expansions:

- **Hi Evening**
- **Hello Evening**

## Change Log
### 4.8 PREVIEW
- \[**BREAKING CHANGES**\]:
    - `ActivityFactory`
        - has been moved to `Microsoft.Bot.Builder`
        - `CreateActivity` renamed to `FromObject`
    - `TemplateEngine`
        - has been renamed to `Templates`
        - `TemplateEngine.EvaluateTemplate` renamed to `Templates.Evaluate`
        - `TemplateEngine.Evaluate` renamed to `Templates.EvaluateText`
        - `TemplateEngine().AddFile` has been replaced by `Templates.ParseFile`
        - `AddFiles` has been deprecated. You no longer can load multiple .lg files. Instead, you should use [import][50] support in your .lg files.
    - Bounding character for expressions has been changed from **@**{expression} to **$**{expression}

    |  Old  | New |
    |-------|-----|
    |  # myTemplate <br/> - I have @{user.name} as your name |  # myTemplate <br/> - I have ${user.name} as your name |
    | # myTemplate <br/> - @{ackPhrase()} <br/><br/> # ackPhrase <br/> - hi <br/>- hello | # myTemplate <br/> - ${ackPhrase()} <br/><br/> # ackPhrase <br/> - hi <br/>- hello |
    | # myTemplate <br/> - IF : @{user.name == null} <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- hello<br/>- ELSE : <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- null | # myTemplate <br/> - IF : ${user.name == null} <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- hello<br/>- ELSE : <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- null |
- New sample [C#][100], [JS][101] that demonstrates how to extend the set of prebuilt expression functions and using custom functions in LG.
- You can now use back-quote for string interpolation. e.g. \`=json({'user': ${user.name}})`
### 4.7 PREVIEW
- \[**BREAKING CHANGES**\]:
    - Old way to refer to a template via `[TemplateName]` notation is deprecated in favor of `${TemplateName()}` notation. There are no changes to how structured response templates are defined.
    - All expressions must now be enclosed within `${<expression>}`. The old notation `{<expression>}` is no longer supported.
    - `ActivityBuilder` has been deprecated and removed in favor of `ActivityFactory`. Note that by stable release, functionality offered by `ActivityFactory` is likely to move into `MessageFactory`.

    |  Old  | New |
    |-------|-----|
    | # myTemplate <br/> - I have {user.name} as your name |  # myTemplate <br/> - I have @{user.name} as your name |
    | # myTemplate <br/> - [ackPhrase] <br/><br/> # ackPhrase <br/> - hi <br/>- hello | # myTemplate <br/> - @{ackPhrase()} <br/><br/> # ackPhrase <br/> - hi <br/>- hello |

- \[**NEW**\]:
    - Language generation preview is now available for JavaScript as well. Checkout [packages][15]. See [samples][26]
    - New `ActivityFactory` class that helps transform structured response template output from LG into a Bot framework activity.
    - Bug fixes and stability improvements.

### 4.6 PREVIEW 2
- \[**BREAKING CHANGES**\]:
    - Old `display || speak` notation is deprecated in favor of structured template support. See below for more details on structured template.
    - Old `Chatdown` style cards are deprecated in favor of structured template support. See below for more details on structured template.
- \[**NEW**\]:
    - Structured Template support in .lg file format. See [response template](../language-generation/language-generation-structured-response-template.md) to learn more about Structured Template definition.
    - ActivityGenerator.GenerateFromLG static method to transform output from LG sub-system into a full blown [Bot Framework Activity][1]

### 4.6 PREVIEW
- \[**NEW**\] [VS code extension][22] for LG (syntax highlighting, auto-suggest (including expressions, pre-built functions, template names etc), validation)
- LG file format:
    - Support for [Switch..Case..Default][20]
    - Support for [import reference][21] to another .lg file.
- [API changes][2]:
    - Dropped FromFile and FromText methods in favor of AddFile and AddFiles.
    - Added ability to provide a delegate to externally resolve import references found in content.
- \[**NEW**\] Translate functionality in [MSLG CLI][23]

### 4.5 PREVIEW
- Initial preview release
