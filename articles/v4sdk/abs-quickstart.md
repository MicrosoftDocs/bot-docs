# Create an Azure Bot resource

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-v4](../includes/applies-to-v4-current.md)]

The _Azure Bot_ resource allows you to register your bot with the Azure Bot Service and to connect your bot to channels. You can build, connect, and manage bots to interact with your users wherever they are, from your app or website to Teams, Messenger and many other channels. To learn how to create a bot, see the [Create a bot with the Bot Framework SDK](../bot-service-quickstart-create-bot.md) quickstart.
