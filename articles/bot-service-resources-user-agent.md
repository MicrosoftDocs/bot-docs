# Bot Framework User-Agent requests

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-v4](includes/applies-to-v4-current.md)]

If you're reading this message, you may have received a request from a Microsoft Bot Framework service. This guide will help you understand the nature of these requests and provide steps to stop them, if so desired.

If you received a request from our service, it likely had a User-Agent header formatted similar to the string below:

`User-Agent: BF-DirectLine/3.0 (Microsoft-BotFramework/3.0 +https://botframework.com/ua)`

The most important part of this string is the **Microsoft-BotFramework** identifier, which is used by the Microsoft Bot Framework, a collection of tools and services that allows independent software developers to create and operate their own bots.

If you're a bot developer, you may already know why these requests are being directed to your service. If not, continue reading to learn more.

## Why is Microsoft contacting my service?

The Bot Framework connects users on chat services like Facebook Messenger to bots, which are web servers with REST APIs running on internet-accessible endpoints. The HTTP calls to bots (also called webhook calls) are sent only to URLs specified by a bot developer who registered with the Bot Framework developer portal.

If you're receiving unsolicited requests from Bot Framework services to your web service, it is likely because a developer has either accidentally or knowingly entered your URL as the webhook callback for their bot.

## To stop these requests

For assistance in stopping undesired requests from reaching your web service, please contact [bf-reports@microsoft.com](mailto://bf-reports@microsoft.com).
