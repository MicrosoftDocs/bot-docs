# Test and debug with the Emulator

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-v4](includes/applies-to-v4-current.md)]

Bot Framework Emulator is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug bots, either locally or remotely. Using the Emulator, you can chat with your bot and inspect the messages that your bot sends and receives. The Emulator displays messages as they would appear in a web chat UI and logs JSON requests and responses as you exchange messages with your bot. Before you deploy your bot to the cloud, run it locally and test it using the Emulator. You can test your bot using the Emulator even if you haven't yet [created](./bot-service-quickstart.md) it with Azure Bot Service or configured it to run on any channels.

## Prerequisites

- Install [Bot Framework Emulator](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/blob/master/README.md)

## Run a bot locally

Before connecting your bot to the Bot Framework Emulator, you need to run your bot locally. You can use Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code to run your bot, or use command line.
To run a bot using command line, do the following:

### [C#](#tab/csharp)

- Go to the command prompt and change directory to your bot project directory.
- Start the bot by running the following command:

    ```cmd
    dotnet run
    ```

- Copy the port number in the line before *Application started. Press CTRL+C to shut down.*

### [JavaScript](#tab/javascript)

- Go to the command prompt and change directory to your bot project directory.
- Start the bot by running the following command:

    ```cmd
    node index.js
    ```

- Copy the port number that restify is listening on.

    :::image type="content" source="media/bot-service-debug-emulator/js_port_number.png" alt-text="JavaScript port number":::

### [Java](#tab/java)

- Go to the command prompt and change directory to your bot project directory.

- If this is the first time, build the bot running the following command:

    ```cmd
    mvn package
    ```

- Start the bot by running the following command:

    ```cmd
    java -jar .\target\<bot archive name>.jar
    ```

- Copy the port number that Tomcat web server is listening on.

    :::image type="content" source="media/bot-service-debug-emulator/java_port_number.png" alt-text="Java port number":::

### [Python](#tab/python)

- Go to the command prompt and change directory to your bot project directory.
- Start the bot by running the following command:

    ```cmd
   python app.py
    ```

- Copy the port number that restify is listening on.

    :::image type="content" source="media/bot-service-debug-emulator/python_port_number.png" alt-text="Python port number":::

At this point, your bot should be running locally.

## Connect to a bot running on localhost

### Configure proxy settings

When you are developing behind a corporate proxy, the Emulator will use the configured environment variables `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY`, which specify the proxy URL route for HTTP and HTTPs requests respectively.

If you are connecting to a bot running on `localhost`, the Emulator will first try to route through the proxy before connecting to `localhost`. Typically, the proxy will block the connection unless you specify that it should be bypassed for `localhost`.

In order to bypass the `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` settings and allow the Emulator to connect to `localhost`, on your local machine you must define the following environment variable :

```cmd
NO_PROXY=localhost
```

<!-- auth config steps -->
### Configure the Emulator for authentication

If a bot requires authentication, displaying a login dialog, you must configure the Emulator as shown below.

#### Using a sign-in verification code

1. Start the Emulator.
1. In the Emulator, select **Settings** (the gear icon) in the left pane.
1. Enable **Bypass ngrok for local addresses**.
1. Enable **Use a sign-in verification code for OAuthCards**.
1. Select **Save**.

When you select the login button displayed by the bot, a validation code will be generated.
You'll enter the code in the bot input chat box for the authentication to take place.
After that you can perform the allowed operations.

Alternatively, you can perform the steps described below.

#### Using authentication tokens

1. Start the Emulator.
1. In the Emulator, select **Settings** (the gear icon) in the left pane.
1. Enter the local path to ngrok. For more information about ngrok, see [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).
1. Enable **Run ngrok when the Emulator starts up**.
1. Enable **Use version 1.0 authentication tokens**.
1. Select **Save**.

When you select the login button displayed by the bot, you will be asked to enter your credentials. An authentication token is generated. After that you can perform the allowed operations.

:::image type="content" source="media/emulator-v4/emulator-welcome.png" alt-text="Emulator startup window":::

To connect to a bot running locally, select **Open bot**. Add the port number your copied earlier into the following URL and paste the updated URL in the Bot URL bar:

`http://localhost:<port number>/api/messages`

:::image type="content" source="media/bot-service-debug-emulator/open_bot_emulator.png" alt-text="Emulator open-a-bot dialog":::

If your bot is running with [Microsoft Account (MSA) credentials](#use-bot-credentials), enter these credentials too.

### Use bot credentials

When you open the bot, set the **Microsoft App ID** and **Microsoft App password** if your bot is running with credentials. If you created your bot with the Azure Bot Service, the credentials are available on the bot's App Service, under the **Settings -> Configuration** section. If you do not know the values, you can remove those from the locally running bot's configuration file, then run the bot in the Emulator. If the bot isn't running with these settings, you don't need to run the Emulator with the settings either.

When creating an AD identity provider application, remember the following:

- When the supported account types is set to single tenant, if you use a personal subscription instead of a Microsoft account, the Emulator would issue the error: *The bot's Microsoft App ID or Microsoft App Password is incorrect..*
- In this case, the supported account types must be set to *Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Xbox)*.

For more information, see [Create an Azure AD identity provider application](bot-builder-tutorial-authentication.md#create-an-azure-ad-identity-provider-application) and [Register a new application using the Azure portal](/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#register-a-new-application-using-the-azure-portal).

## View detailed Message Activities with the Inspector

Send a message to your bot and the bot should respond back. You can select the message bubble within the conversation window and inspect the raw JSON activity using the **INSPECTOR** feature to the right side of the window. When selected, the message bubble will turn yellow and the activity JSON object will be displayed to the left of the chat window. The JSON information includes key metadata, including the channel ID, activity type, conversation ID, the text message, endpoint URL, and so on. You can inspect activities sent from the user, as well as activities the bot responds with.

> [!TIP]
> You can debug state changes in a bot connected to a channel by adding [Inspection Middleware](bot-service-debug-inspection-middleware.md) to the bot.

## Inspect services

[!INCLUDE [qnamaker-sunset-alert](includes/qnamaker-sunset-alert.md)]

With the v4 Emulator you can also inspect the JSON responses from LUIS and QnA Maker. Using a bot with a connected language service, you can select **trace** in the LOG window to the bottom right. This new tool also provides features to update your language services directly from the Emulator.

:::image type="content" source="media/emulator-v4/emulator-luis-inspector.png" alt-text="LUIS Inspector":::

With a connected LUIS service, you'll notice that the trace link specifies **Luis Trace**. When selected, you'll see the raw response from your LUIS service, which includes intents, entities along with their specified scores. You also have the option to re-assign intents for your user utterances.

:::image type="content" source="media/emulator-v4/emulator-qna-inspector.png" alt-text="QnA Inspector":::

With a connected QnA Maker service, the log will display **QnA Trace**. When selected, you can preview the question and answer pair associated with that activity, along with a confidence score. From here, you can add alternative question phrasing for an answer.

### Login to Azure

You can use the Emulator to sign in to your Azure account. This is particularly helpful for you to add and manage services your bot depends on. Log into Azure by following these steps:

1. Select **File**, then **Sign in with Azure**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/emulator-v4/emulator-azure-login.png" alt-text="Emulator sign in with Azure":::

1. On the **Welcome** screen, select **Sign in with your Azure account**. You can optionally have Emulator keep you signed in across Emulator application restarts.

    :::image type="content" source="media/emulator-v4/emulator-azure-login-success.png" alt-text="Emulator Azure sign in success":::

## Disabling data collection

If you decide that you no longer want to allow the Emulator to collect usage data, you can easily disable data collection by following these steps:

1. In the Emulator, select **Settings** (the gear icon) in the left pane.

    :::image type="content" source="media/emulator-v4/emulator-disable-data-1.png" alt-text="Emulator settings button":::

1. Under **Data Collection**, deselect **Help improve the Emulator by allowing us to collect usage data**.
1. Select **Save**.

If you change your mind, you can reenable data collection later.
