# Create a bot with the Bot Framework SDK for Python

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-v4](../includes/applies-to-v4-current.md)]

This article shows you how to build a bot by using the Python Echo Bot template, and then how to test it with the Bot Framework Emulator.

Creating a bot with Azure Bot Service and creating a bot locally are independent, parallel ways to create a bot.
