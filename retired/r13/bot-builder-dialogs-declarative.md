# Create a bot using declarative adaptive dialogs Â 

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-v4](../includes/applies-to-v4-current.md)]

This article shows how to create a bot that incorporates an **Adaptive dialog** using the declarative approach.

## Prerequisites

- Knowledge of [bot basics][concept-basics], [managing state][concept-state], and the [dialogs library][concept-dialogs].
- Knowledge of [adaptive dialogs][concept-adaptive] and [declarative dialogs][concept-declarative].
- Knowledge of the basic concepts of how to [Create a bot using adaptive dialogs][how-to-adaptive], this article builds on that knowledge.
- A copy of the declarative **EchoBot** [C# sample][cs-sample].

### Preliminary steps to add a declarative adaptive dialog to a bot

You must follow these steps to load and use a declarative dialog in a bot.

1. Update all Bot Builder NuGet packages to version 4.9.x.
1. Create the declarative files.
1. Add the required packages and references to your bot project.
1. Register the Bot Framework's declarative components for adaptive dialogs.
1. Use a dialog manager in the bot code to start or continue the root dialog each turn.
1. Create a resource explorer in the bot code to load the declarative resources.

## About the sample

This sample, the Bot Framework Adaptive Dialog declarative Echo bot, demonstrates using a declaratively-defined [adaptive dialog][concept-adaptive] that accepts input from the user and echoes it back.

## Create the declarative files

Declarative dialog files are language-agnostic JSON files that declare the elements of a dialog, meaning that they are the same regardless which language you use to create your bot. They typically have an extension of `.dialog`. The **EchoBot** sample only contains one adaptive dialog with a trigger to handle the `UnknownIntent` event, which when it fires it sends a message to the user that echoes what they said: _"You said '${turn.activity.text}'"_.

> [!TIP]
> [Bot Framework Composer](/composer/) is an integrated development tool that developers and multi-disciplinary teams can use to build bots. The bots created by Bot Framework Composer are built using the declarative approach.

The [declarative file][main.dialog] for the **EchoBot** sample:

```json
{
  "$schema": "../app.schema",
  "$kind": "Microsoft.AdaptiveDialog",
  "triggers": [
    {
      "$kind": "Microsoft.OnUnknownIntent",
      "actions": [
        {
          "$kind": "Microsoft.SendActivity",
          "activity":  "You said '${turn.activity.text}'"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> It is generally a good practice to keep your declarative files in a sub-folder named `dialogs`, however they can be anywhere. You load them into your bot using the `ResourceExplorer.GetResources()` method.

### Creating the schema file

The schema file referenced by the `"$schema` keyword contains the schemas of all the components that are consumed by your bot. For information on the `"$schema` keyword and schema file referenced in `.dialog` files, see the [Using declarative assets in adaptive dialogs](bot-builder-concept-adaptive-dialog-declarative.md#declarative-files) article.

To create the schema file referenced in the `.dialog` file you need the [Bot Framework Command-Line Interface (BF CLI)][bf-cli]. If you do not already have this installed, you can install the BF CLI from the command line:

```cmd
npm i -g @microsoft/botframework-cli
```

Using the Bot Framework Command-Line Interface (BF CLI) in the command line, from the root directory of your project run `bf dialog:merge <filename.csproj>`:

```cmd
bf dialog:merge EchoBot.csproj
```

This creates a file named App.Schema in the same directory that the command was executed in.

<!--
'$ bf dialog:merge *.csproj',
'$ bf dialog:merge libraries/*.schema -o app.schema'
-->

> [!TIP]
> If the `"$schema` keyword is missing, or points to an invalid or non-existent file you will not get any warnings or errors and it will not impact the functionality of your bot when running, however a valid App.Schema file is required for _Intelligent code completion_ tools such as [IntelliSense][intelliSense] to work with any of the declarative assets.

## Add references to declarative components

Declarative only works with adaptive dialogs. To enable adaptive in your bot install the **Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Dialogs.Adaptive** NuGet package, then create the following references in your code in **Startup.cs**:

[!code-CSharp[Startup.cs-Using-Statements](~/../botbuilder-samples/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/adaptive-dialog/20.EchoBot-declarative/Startup.cs?range=4-17&highlight=7-9)]

Also in **EchoBot.cs**:

[!code-CSharp[EchoBot.cs-Using-Statements](~/../botbuilder-samples/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/adaptive-dialog/20.EchoBot-declarative/echoBot.cs?range=4-10&highlight=6-7)]

<!--
```CS
using Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Dialogs.Adaptive;
using Microsoft.Bot.Builder.Dialogs.Declarative.Resources;
```
-->

## Register declarative components for adaptive dialogs

[!code-CSharp[ConfigureServices](~/../botbuilder-samples/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/adaptive-dialog/20.EchoBot-declarative/Startup.cs?range=30-67&highlight=6-16,33-34)]

<!--
```CS
ComponentRegistration.Add(new DialogsComponentRegistration());
ComponentRegistration.Add(new DeclarativeComponentRegistration());
var resourceExplorer = new ResourceExplorer().LoadProject(this.HostingEnvironment.ContentRootPath);
services.AddSingleton(resourceExplorer);
```
-->

## Create the dialog declaratively

Declarative dialogs are not typical code files. The resource explorer can interpret the resource and generate an instance of the described dialog. Use a resource explorer to load them at run time.

Create properties for the `ResourceExplorer` and `DialogManager` your bot will use. Use dependency injection to set the resource explorer in the `EchoBot` constructor.

[!code-CSharp[EchoBot-Constructor](~/../botbuilder-samples/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/adaptive-dialog/20.EchoBot-declarative/EchoBot.cs?range=14-23&highlight=4-5,7,10)]

<!--
```Csharp
    public class EchoBot : ActivityHandler
    {
        private IStatePropertyAccessor<DialogState> dialogStateAccessor;
        private readonly ResourceExplorer resourceExplorer;
        private DialogManager dialogManager;

        public EchoBot(ConversationState conversationState, ResourceExplorer resourceExplorer)
        {
            this.dialogStateAccessor = conversationState.CreateProperty<DialogState>("RootDialogState");
            this.resourceExplorer = resourceExplorer;
            ...
```
-->

You can optionally set the dialog to update with new settings anytime the underlying `.dialog` file changes using the `resourceExplorer.Changed` method:

[!code-CSharp[resourceExplorer.Changed](~/../botbuilder-samples/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/adaptive-dialog/20.EchoBot-declarative/EchoBot.cs?range=25-32)]

<!--
```Csharp
// auto reload dialogs when file changes
this.resourceExplorer.Changed += (e, resources) =>
{
    if (resources.Any(resource => resource.Id.EndsWith == ".dialog"))
    {
        Task.Run(() => this.LoadRootDialogAsync());
    }
};
```
-->

Finally, you create a declarative dialog resource that you load into the dialog manager like you would any other adaptive dialog.

[!code-CSharp[CreateDeclarativeDialog](~/../botbuilder-samples/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/adaptive-dialog/20.EchoBot-declarative/EchoBot.cs?range=42-45)]

<!--
```Csharp
var resource = this.resourceExplorer.GetResource("main.dialog");
dialogManager = new DialogManager(resourceExplorer.LoadType<AdaptiveDialog>(resource));
dialogManager.UseResourceExplorer(resourceExplorer);
dialogManager.UseLanguageGeneration();
```
-->

The resource explorer's `GetResource` method reads the declarative file into a resource object, and its `LoadType` method casts the resource to an `AdaptiveDialog` object. Here, this is the **main.dialog** file.
You can then create a dialog manager as you would for any other adaptive dialog. the dialog is being read in and created from the declarative file instead of defined in code.

The dialog manager's `UseResourceExplorer` method registers the resource explorer so that the dialog manager can make use of it later, as necessary. The `UseLanguageGeneration` method tells the dialog manager which language generator to use.

In this case, since no language generation (LG) template file is provided, and this project does not include a **main.lg** default LG file, the dialog manager will use the default language generator, without any predefined templates. However, the echo bot includes an in-line LG template used in the dialog. It is defined in **main.dialog**.

[!code-json[main.dialog](~/../botbuilder-samples/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/adaptive-dialog/20.EchoBot-declarative/Dialogs/main.dialog?range=1-15&highlight=10)]

## Test the bot

1. If you have not done so already, install the [Bot Framework Emulator](https://aka.ms/bot-framework-emulator-readme).
1. Run the sample locally on your machine.
1. Start the Emulator, connect to your bot, and send messages as shown below.
