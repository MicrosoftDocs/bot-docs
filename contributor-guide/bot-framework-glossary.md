# Bot Framework glossary

Contains a consolidated list of collected terms for the Bot Framework SDK docs, and by extension, the Composer docs. This is not meant to be the definitive source of truth, but notes taken as we hunt down the official terms to use. Meant to be a living document, as definitions and official terms will change over time.

To try to keep this from exploding, the intent to to capture terms that either are not easy to otherwise look up or we are constantly looking up but are not likely to change frequently.

### Resources

These should be considered the sources of truth, and you _should not_ "use Microsoft.com, any other web page, or product UI as a source for product and feature names, capitalization, spelling, and usage".

#### On Corpnet

- [Microsoft Cloud Style Guide][] / **A–Z names + terms dictionary** &mdash; Cloud-specific style guide.
- [Microsoft Writing Style Guide][] / **A–Z word list and term collections** &mdash; Microsoft-wide style guide.
- [Microsoft 365 Style Guide][] / **A–Z word list** &mdash; for terms specific to Microsoft 365, in addition to Windows, Office 365, and Microsoft Teams.

#### Other

When in doubt and we don't have guidance yet, check with an appropriate subject matter expert, and get a second opinion, if the first answer seems odd or otherwise dubious.

- Who on the Bot Framework team can answer these questions is more difficult than it should be. Marieke may be able to field a response.

### General entry format

- **Heading**: The complete term to use on first mention, including proper casing and official acronym (if applicable).
  - **Status**: Indicates whether the term is approved, internal jargon, or other.
  - **Short form**: If applicable, shorter forms of the term that can be used on subsequent mention in an article, as long as context makes it clear.
  - **Forms**: For some product names, lists the various forms the name can take, with the "the" included, if applicable.

  - **Notes**: Additional notes, if any.

### Context

For many terms that start with the word Microsoft or Azure, like Microsoft Azure App Service Environment, the _Microsoft_ or _Azure_ bit can be left off if the context is obvious within the article itself. Remember that readers may land on any given page from a search.

<a id="event"></a>
<a id="event-activity"></a>

## event

- **Status**: Complicated, see notes.
- **Definition**: The occurrence of an action in a system. Whenever you have a system that can react to some (internal or external) stimulus, the system can be described as recognizing certain events (stimuli) for which the developer can register or define handlers (that define the way in which the system will react).
- **Notes**: Any object that might represent some kind of event is often called an event, so always clarify 1) what category of event you're talking about, and 2) as applicable, what type of event within that category. For this same reason, don't casually call something an event that hasn't been defined specifically as one.
- **Examples**: None of the category names are proper nouns, so none of them would be capitalized unless they appear at the start of a sentence. For sample events, most of these are descriptive. Sample events that use the verbatim name of the event are in italic.
  | Category | Description | Sample event types in this category |
  |:-|:-|:-|
  | activity | An `event` activity is a specific type of [activity](#activity). | The meaning of the event activity is defined by the channel and the activity's `name` property. |
  | activity handler | Each type (and sometimes each subtype) of activity received by the bot is thought of as the event. | Message activity, conversation update activity, members added, event activity, token-response event activity, and so on. |
  | activity handler, Teams | The Teams activity handler has a finer-grained approach to `event` and `invoke` activities, but otherwise is similar to the base activity handler. | Channel created, _fileConsent/invoke_, and so on. |
  | dialogs library |  |  |
  | dialogs, adaptive | Anything that can satisfy a condition that will cause a trigger to fire. These are broken down further into subcategories. The types are implicit on the SDK side and explicit, if a bit fanciful, on the Composer side. Similar in some ways to activity handler events, but much more elaborate. | Intent recognized, dialog started, event activity received, message received, custom event, and so on. |
  | skills |  |  |
  | telemetry | Some aspect of the telemetry feature classifies certain activities within a bot into events that it can log. | Activity, bot errors, waterfall start, bot message received, bot message send, and so on. |
  | turn context | Your bot and middleware can register event handlers on the turn context to allow them to react when an activity is sent from the bot. | Send activity, update activity, and delete activity. |
- **See also**: [activity](#activity), [adaptive dialog](#adaptive-dialog), [dialog](#dialog).

## repository

- **Status**: In general use, though its meaning varies.
- **Definition**: A central location (to varying extents) that contains code or packages. This can be at anywhere from the project level or platform level.

  - Don't spell out _software development kit_.
  - For the Bot Framework, we use the artificial distinction of API for the REST services (Connector, Direct Line) and SDK for the Bot Framework SDK (built on top of the Connector REST API).
  - When ambiguous, qualify which SDK you're talking about. This might also include qualifying the release version or programming language.
- **Examples**:
- **See also**: [API](#api), [library](#library), [Microsoft Bot Framework SDK](#bot-framework-sdk).

## the

- Whether to use "the" or not with a product name is tricky, and there are as many exceptions as rules of thumb. See the glossary entry for each product name.
- Often, when a name is used as an adjective to modify another word, precede the phrase with "the", unless the whole phrase is itself a proper name.
- **Examples**: [the Emulator](#emulator), Composer (the Bot Framework Composer), Teams (Microsoft Teams).

  - a WebSocket client &mdash; a browser or web app that requests the connection from the server.
  - a WebSocket server &mdash; a web service with an endpoint for WebSocket connections.
  - a WebSocket endpoint &mdash; an endpoint for a web service for WebSocket connections.
  - a WebSocket &mdash; Generally refers to a WebSocket connection or endpoint, depending on context; qualify as necessary.
  - WebSockets &mdash; the supporting technology, protocol or API, and so on.
- **Definition**:
  - From the IEFT standard, "The WebSocket protocol enables two-way communication between a client running untrusted code in a controlled environment to a remote host that has opted-in to communications from that code."
