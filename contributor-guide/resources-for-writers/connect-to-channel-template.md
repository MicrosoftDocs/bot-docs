# How to connect a bot to {channel-name}

<!-- Introductory paragraphs:

This article describes how to connect a bot to {channel-name}.
The {channel-name} channel lets your bot communicate with users through {summary-of-service-or-device}.

# If there's an official custom channel adapter, mention it with a link to its docs (in V5, the SDK proper will no longer contain concrete custom channel adapters).

-->

<!-- Add explanation of the most important moving pieces of the channel's docs, with links, such as:
- the root of their dev docs
- if different, the start of the bot-specific topic set
- their schema docs
# our activity and card schema docs:
- For more information about the Bot Framework protocols, see:
  [Bot Framework activity schema](https://github.com/Microsoft/botframework-sdk/blob/main/specs/botframework-activity/botframework-activity.md) and
  [Bot Framework card schema](https://github.com/Microsoft/botframework-sdk/blob/main/specs/botframework-activity/botframework-cards.md).
-->

## Prerequisites

<!-- Remove this section if prerequisites are not needed

# If the how-to requires Azure.
- An Azure subscription. If you don't already have one, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.
- A bot published to Azure that you want to connect to {channel-name}.

# If the how-to requires a channel-specific developer account, prefer their phrasing for the link for creating the account.
- If you don't have a {channel-name} developer account, [{sign-up-for-one}]({their-link}).

# Add additional prereqs as necessary.

-->

<!--
If the user need to go back and forth between the Azure portal and the channel's developer site.
Make explicit which site the subprocess is for, both in the heading and as the first step of the procedure.
-->
## {do-subprocess} in {site}

<!-- steps, with optional preamble-->

## Test the connection

<!-- Procedures
# This should be pretty light, as the sample bot should be ready'ish.
-->

## Additional information

<!-- Does the channel support a testing/staging environment for bot clients?
# If so, point to their docs for managing that.
-->

### Bot support in the {channel-name}

<!-- Overview of supported aspects of the channel...if we can get this info from the devs.
# What gets mapped to what, in both directions?
   - what Bot Framework features are supported or not? How are they surfaced in the channel?
   - what channel features are supported or not? How are they surfaced as an activity?
# Are there novel timing restrictions?
# Are there novel authentication requirements?
-->
