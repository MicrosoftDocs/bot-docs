## Repos

These repos are part of the C# reference doc pipeline.

| Repo | Role |

| [MicrosoftDocs/bot-docs-pr](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/bot-docs-pr) | The **\\dotnet** directory is the bucket for the intermediate files generated from the NuGet packages. |

## Package repositories

The main sources for NuGet packages are NuGet (stable/official) and [BotBuilder.MyGet](https://botbuilder.myget.org/gallery/) (daily).

## Tools (for local builds)

The [Onboarding guide][] has info on how to run local builds, see [How to Test a .NET-based API Reference Project Locally](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/onboard/admin/reference/dotnet/testing-locally?branch=main).

Tools:

- [nue](https://github.com/docascode/nue/)&mdash;optional, to extract assemblies from NuGet packages.
- [mdoc](https://github.com/mono/api-doc-tools/)&mdash;to create a reflected API representation from the assemblies.
- [ECMA2YAML](https://github.com/docascode/ECMA2Yaml)&mdash;optional, to convert from mdoc to YAML.
- [DocFX](https://github.com/dotnet/docfx/releases)&mdash;to generate a local version of the ref docs.

## Cross-team coordination

### Before an SDK release

- **Dev team** adds or updates code in the botbuilder-js repo.
- **Doc team** adds or updates code comments and submits PRs against the botbuilder-dotnet repo.

### Pushing an SDK release

- **Dev team** builds the NuGet packages and publishes them to the NuGet site.

  In theory, they update the list of [current C# packages](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-dotnet#packages) on the botbuilder-dotnet `README` page.

### After an SDK release

1. **Docs team** submits an onboarding request. (If we have a hard release date, we can submit this a day or two early to get it on their calendar.)
1. **Pubs team** processes the request. They'll ask us to check the review site to verify that everything looks right.
   - At this point, we can only fix doc build and package omission issues, as the dev team does not like to republish packages.
   - If there is an egregious ref doc error, we can probably add an overwrite (in the bot-docs-pr repo) and have them rebuild the docs.
   - Once we approve the review build, they will push the changes live.
