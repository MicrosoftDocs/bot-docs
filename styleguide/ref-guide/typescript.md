## Repos

These repos are part of the JavaScript reference doc pipeline.

| Repo | Role |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Microsoft/BotBuilder-js](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-js) | Source libraries for the JavaScript/TypeScript SDK. |
| [MicrosoftDocs/botbuilder-docs-sdk-typescript](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/botbuilder-docs-sdk-typescript) | Bucket for the intermediate files generated from the npm packages. |
| [MicrosoftDocs/bot-docs-pr](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/bot-docs-pr) | The larger Bot Framework doc set in which the ref docs are included. |

## Tools (for local builds)

The [Onboarding guide][] has info on how to run local builds. For us, this currently requires:

- Globally install the [type2docfx][type2docfx-npm] package.

  ```cmd
  npm i -g type2docfx --save-dev
  ```

- Globally install the [typedoc][typedoc-npm] package.

  ```cmd
  npm i -g typedoc
  ```

- Download the [docfx][docfx-tool] tool from https://github.com/dotnet/docfx/releases

  This downloads a .zip file. Extract the contents to a directory you can easily find, such as **C:\\Program Files\\docfx\\**.

## Cross-team coordination

### Before a release

- **Dev team** adds or updates code in the botbuilder-js repo.
- **Doc team** adds or updates code comments and submits PRs against the botbuilder-js repo.

### Pushing a release

- **Dev team** builds the npm packages and publishes them to the npm site.

  In theory, they update the list of [current JavaScript packages](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js#packages) on the botbuilder-js README page.

### After a release

1. **Docs team** submits an onboarding request. (If we have a hard release date, we can submit this a day or two early to get it on their calendar.)
1. **Pubs team** processes the request. They'll ask us to check the review site to verify that everything looks right.
   - At this point, we can only fix doc build and package omission issues, as the dev team does not like to republish packages.
   - If there is an egregious ref doc error, we can probably add an overwrite (repo tbd: either bot-docs-pr or botbuilder-docs-sdk-typescript) and have them rebuild the docs.
   - Once we approve the review build, they will push the changes live.

## Markup and boilerplate

We should only use [typeDoc][typeDoc docs] supported markup, though these sections can include Markdown. The only JSDoc markup that _should_ work that isn't covered by typeDoc is the `@remarks` tag. See [JSDoc usage][] and the [jsdoc repo][] for info for JSDoc.

See these resources for TypeScript and JavaScript:
- [TypeScript docs][]&mdash;an official TypeScript language reference.
- [MDN JavaScript docs][]&mdash;Mozilla developer network resources for JavaScript.
- [Node.js docs][]&mdash;Node.js documentation.

The rest of these sections cover style and wording guidance. It is intended to supplement OPS guidance in the [Docs contributor guide][] and the [Onboarding guide][].

### Text formatting

| Item | Guidance | Markdown example
|:-|:-|:-
| language keyword | **bold**
| literal or short, in-line code snippet | `code` | ```Calling `await next();` will cause execution to...```
| string value | "value"
| emphasis | _italic_
| new term | _italic_
| placeholder text | _italic_. Depending on context, optionally put the placeholder text inside angle brackets (\<>) or braces ({}).
| class or member | A symbol reference on first use, and **bold** on subsequent uses. | ```To add middleware to a [BotAdapter](xref:botbuilder-core.BotAdapter) object, call the adapter's [use](xref:botbuilder-core.BotAdapter.use) method. The **use** method...```

### Symbol references

Use `[link-text](xref:uid)` style links to link to other Bot Framework and Microsoft TypeScript ref docs.

To find the uid for JavaScript, go to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/javascript/api/ and search for the member you want to link to. The uid will be the link text, as opposed to the link target.
For example, the xref uid for the BotAdapter.use method is __botbuilder-core.BotAdapter.use__.

For links into our docs, link "directly" to the article, such as https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-howto-send-messages for the **Send and receive text messages** how to.

For links to other docs, use an aka link as you would in the conceptual topics.

### @module

A `module` tag at the top of a code file should generate module-level documentation. Only one file should be used to document each module. In other words, choose one file per module to use for module-level comments.

### Summary

Every public element should have a description, including protected members of public classes or interfaces:

- When in doubt, open with a verb phrase. Include one or two more short sentences as necessary, but leave most of the explanation for the remarks section.
- If a public element is _internal_, include the following note as part of the summary:

  ```text
  This <element-type> supports the framework and is not intended to be called directly from your code.
  ```

| Element | Guidance | Markdown example
| :--- | :--- | :---
| File                | TBD
| Concrete class      | Use a noun or verb phrase. | **TurnContext**<br/>```Provides context for a turn of a bot.```<br/>**Messagefactory**<br/>```A set of utility functions to assist with the formatting of the various message types a bot can return.```
| Interface           | Use a verb phrase. | **DialogState**<br/>```Contains dialog state, information about the state of the dialog stack, for a specific [DialogSet](xref:botbuilder-dialogs.DialogSet).```
| Abstract base class | Start with "Defines the core behavior of/for" | **Dialog**<br/>```Defines the core behavior for all dialogs.```
| Derived class or interface (extends or implements) | (There's a bug in the build system. The unlinked base class is included, but the interfaces are not.) Mention all base classes and interfaces. Also, try to describe the class or interface in terms similar to how the base class or interface is described. | **ActivityHandler**<br/>```Event-emitting activity handler for bots. Extends [ActivityHandlerBase](xref:botbuilder-core.ActivityHandlerBase).``` |
| Generic class or interface | If relevant, mention the generic type parameter as part of the overall summary. |
| Constructor         | Start with "Creates an new instance of the \[\<_class-name_>](xref:\<_class-uid_>) class." If there are multiple constructors, indicate in the description what makes each overload relevant.
| Constructor in abstract class | Start with "Called from constructors in derived classes to initialize the \[\<_class-name_>](xref:\<_class-uid_>) class."
| Property            | Depending on which accessors are defined, use a verb phrase that starts with "Gets", "Sets", or "Gets or sets".
| Function property, method, or function | Use a verb phrase that describes the behavior. | **TurnContext.getMentions()**<br/>```Gets all at-mention entities included in an activity.```
| `async` method | Use a verb phrase that starts with "Asynchronously". | **BotFrameworkAdapter.continueConversation()**<br/>```Asynchronously resumes a conversation with a user, possibly after some time has gone by.```
| Generator function  | TBD
| Overloaded method   | Include in the summary what makes each overload relevant. | 
| Abstract or interface method | Start with "When implemented in a derived class," and complete with a verb phrase.

### Object types

| Type | Guidance | Markdown example
| :--- | :--- |:---
| **boolean**        | For the summary, start with "Indicates whether" and describe the thing to do or the condition that holds if the value is true.<br/><br/>For the remarks, "**true** \<_to do x_ or _when y_>; otherwise, **false**." If the false condition requires more explanation, can complete the sentence with "; or false \<_to do p_ or _when q_>."

### @returns

Currently, the doc build does not include a description along with the return value.

However, if a value is returned, make sure to describe it in the `@remarks` section.

| Return value | Guidance | Markdown example
| :--- | :--- |:-
| **void**, **null**, **undefined**, or **never**, or a **Promise** for any of these | There's no need to mention the return value.
| **this** | For _cascading/fluent_ semantics, use "A reference to the \<_object-name_> object." | **ActivityHandler.onEvent()**<br/>```Returns a reference to the [ActivityHandler](xref:botbuilder-core.ActivityHandler) object.```
| other type | In the remarks, describe what the return value represents and what to do with it.
| **Promise\<_T_>** | Start with something like "If the operation is successful," and complete with a description of the return value. | **TurnContext.sendActivity()**<br/>```If the activity is successfully sent, results in a [ResourceResponse](xref:botframework-schema.ResourceResponse) object containing the ID that the receiving channel assigned to the activity.```

### @remarks

<!--
| Element | Wording |
| :--- | :--- |
| in general |  |
| Method that can throw an exception |  |
| in general |  |
-->

Include more information as necessary about the item in the remarks section. You can include short code samples, discussion of a method's return value, discussion of interactions with other classes or methods, and so on.

Sample code sample:

~~~typeDoc
  * For example:
  * ```JavaScript
  * const result = await dc.beginDialog('greeting', { name: user.name });
  * ```
~~~

Optionally, include a _see also_ section. When linking to members of a different class, qualify the link text with the object name.

Sample see also section:

~~~typeDoc
  * **See also**
  * - [endDialog](xref:botbuilder-dialogs.DialogContext.endDialog)
  * - [prompt](xref:botbuilder-dialogs.DialogContext.prompt)
  * - [replaceDialog](xref:botbuilder-dialogs.DialogContext.replaceDialog)
  * - [Dialog.beginDialog](xref:botbuilder-dialogs.Dialog.beginDialog)
~~~

### Code blocks

Fenced code blocks default to JavaScript syntax highlighting, but it doesn't hurt to be explicit.

Add short code examples as desirable to the @remarks section.

- Introduce each example, even if it is just with the phrase, "For example:".
- At the type-level (class, interface, object, enum, and so on), include a code example that will apply to the most common use cases.
- At the method-level, consider adding code examples to the most commonly hit topics.
