## Follow URL patterns for products and services

URLs must be consistent, hierarchical, and as shallow as possible to perform well in search.

To ensure well-structured URLs, use one of following URL patterns:


    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/{technology}/{filename}

    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/{technology}/{userjourney-or-secondary-category}/{filename}
    Use this option if the content set is large and requires deeper hierarchies.

>[!IMPORTANT]

> The more elements (folders) in the URL path, the harder for a search engine to crawl the content. Try to limit URLs to 2-3 levels deep from the base URL https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/

##Follow guidance for friendly filenames
The most complete guidance for friendly filenames is from Azure content. You can adapt it to fit your content set, but the basic friendly URL rules apply:

- Use only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. No other characters are allowed.
- No spaces or punctuation characters. Use the hyphens to separate words and numbers in the file name.
- No more than 80 characters - this is a publishing system limit
- No -ing verbs (gerunds)
- Avoid small words such as a, and, the, in, or, and so on
- All files must be in markdown and use the .md file extension
- Spell the words out; avoid acronyms
- Acronyms and initialisms in filenames

###Spell out service or product names
Do not use acronyms or abbreviations for products, services, or features.
You may use industry-standard acronyms or abbreviations, such as DNS or URL. .

###Filename examples

Here are examples of descriptive, relevant file names:

bot-builder-dotnet-conversations-control-templates.md
resources-install-botbuilder-sdk.md
